# collatz_conjecture

This project focuses on identifying patterns in the outcomes of Collatz conjecture. We will be plotting the outcomes.  
The concept of Collatz conjecture states that any positive number ultimately leads to value 1 when the following operations are iteratively applied to it:

n/2 if the number is even
(3n+2)/2 if the number is odd
Given n is the number we need to operate on

Collatz.py is a helper file that contains functions needed for analysis.
Number_patterns_collatz.py goes through overall analysis.
